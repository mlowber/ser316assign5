# Airport Simulation - Design Patterns

This project is a Java-based **Airport Simulation** that implements **three design patterns**. It is built using **Gradle** and follows best software development practices.

## Planned Design Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern** – Used for creating different types of airplanes.
2. **Observer Pattern** – Used to notify airport components (e.g., gates, control towers) when a flight arrives or departs.
3. **Strategy Pattern** – Used to define different resource allocation strategies for runways and gates.
